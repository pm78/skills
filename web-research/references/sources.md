# Source Routing + Reliability Guide

Use this reference to choose sources that match the topic and to label reliability.

## Reliability Tiers (use in your output)

- **Tier A (Primary / official):** regulators, standards bodies, government statistics, official filings, clinical guidelines, original datasets.
- **Tier B (Research):** peer-reviewed journals and reputable preprints (label preprints clearly).
- **Tier C (Reputable journalism):** major newsrooms with editorial standards; still cross-check claims.
- **Tier D (Interested parties):** company blogs, vendor whitepapers, PR; useful but biased.
- **Tier E (Community signal):** Reddit/Substack/X; use for leads and perspectives, not as evidence for factual claims.

## News (recent events)

**Goal:** get the most recent, credible reporting + primary statements.

**Recommended approach:**
1) Search broad news index (high recall), then filter by domain/tier.
2) Add primary sources (press releases, official posts, regulator sites).

**Tier C domains (examples, non-exhaustive):**
- `reuters.com`, `apnews.com`, `bbc.co.uk`, `npr.org`, `theguardian.com`
- For tech/AI context: `technologyreview.com`, `ft.com` (paywall), `wsj.com` (paywall)

## Health / Medicine (studies + guidelines)

**Goal:** prioritize evidence quality and recency, not virality.

**Tier A (guidelines / authorities):**
- WHO: `who.int`
- CDC: `cdc.gov`
- NIH / NLM: `nih.gov`, `nlm.nih.gov`
- FDA / EMA: `fda.gov`, `ema.europa.eu`
- NICE (UK guidelines): `nice.org.uk`

**Tier B (research discovery):**
- PubMed: `pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` (index) + full text links
- Cochrane (systematic reviews): `cochranelibrary.com` (often access-restricted)
- Clinical trials registry: `clinicaltrials.gov`

## AI (research + reporting + community signal)

**Goal:** combine (1) primary research, (2) reputable reporting, and (3) community discussion as leads.

**Tier B (research):**
- arXiv: `arxiv.org`
- OpenReview (peer review / submissions): `openreview.net`
- ACL Anthology (NLP papers): `aclanthology.org`

**Tier C (reporting / analysis):**
- Stanford HAI: `hai.stanford.edu`
- NIST (AI RMF, standards): `nist.gov`
- OECD AI: `oecd.ai`
- MIT Tech Review: `technologyreview.com`

**Tier E (signal only):**
- Reddit: `reddit.com`
- Substack: `substack.com`
- X: `x.com`

## Finance (markets + macro + companies)

**Goal:** prefer primary market-moving sources (filings/data) and reputable reporting.

**Tier A (primary):**
- SEC / EDGAR (US filings): `sec.gov`
- Federal Reserve: `federalreserve.gov`
- U.S. BLS (labor/inflation): `bls.gov`
- U.S. BEA (GDP): `bea.gov`
- FRED (macro time series): `fred.stlouisfed.org`
- ECB: `ecb.europa.eu`
- IMF / World Bank: `imf.org`, `worldbank.org`

**Tier C (financial press; often paywalled):**
- `ft.com`, `wsj.com`, `bloomberg.com`, `reuters.com`
