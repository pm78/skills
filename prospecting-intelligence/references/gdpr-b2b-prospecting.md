# GDPR Compliance Guide for B2B Prospecting

## Legal Framework

### Applicable Regulation
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) - EU Regulation 2016/679
- **ePrivacy Directive** (2002/58/EC) - for electronic communications
- National implementations may add stricter rules (e.g., France CNIL, Germany BDSG)

### Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (Art. 6(1)(f))

B2B prospecting can rely on **legitimate interest** when:

1. **Purpose is legitimate**: Promoting products/services to businesses is a recognized legitimate interest (Recital 47 GDPR)
2. **Processing is necessary**: No less intrusive way to reach B2B decision-makers at scale
3. **Balanced against data subject rights**: Professional context, limited data, easy opt-out

### When Legitimate Interest Does NOT Apply

- Cold calling/emailing to **personal** (non-professional) contacts
- Processing **sensitive data** (health, political opinions, etc.)
- Targeting individuals in their **private capacity**
- Countries where national law requires **opt-in consent** for B2B emails (check local rules)

## Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) Template

### Section 1: Purpose Test
- **What is the purpose?** B2B sales prospecting for [product/service]
- **Who benefits?** Our company (revenue) and prospects (awareness of relevant solution)
- **Is there a wider public benefit?** Industry efficiency, innovation adoption

### Section 2: Necessity Test
- **Is processing necessary for this purpose?** Yes -- contacting decision-makers requires their professional contact data
- **Could we achieve this with less data?** We minimize to: name, title, company, LinkedIn URL
- **Could we achieve this without personal data?** Not effectively for targeted B2B outreach

### Section 3: Balancing Test
- **What is the impact on individuals?** Minimal -- professional context, easy to opt out
- **Would they expect this processing?** Yes -- B2B professionals expect vendor outreach
- **Are there vulnerable individuals?** No -- targeting business professionals only
- **What safeguards are in place?**
  - Opt-out in every message
  - 90-day retention for non-responders
  - No personal data beyond professional identity
  - Data sourced from publicly available professional profiles

### Conclusion
