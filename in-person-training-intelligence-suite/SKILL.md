# In Person Training Intelligence Suite

## Use
1. Confirm required training context before drafting outputs.
2. Fill all placeholders (for example `[TOPIC]`, `[AUDIENCE]`, `[DURATION]`, `[BUDGET]`) from user input.
3. If inputs are missing, ask only what blocks the requested output.
4. Treat the 12 modules as a methodology library, not a mandatory output structure.
5. Build the response around the user's requested deliverable (for example a 2-day program design), then apply only the relevant methodology modules.
6. Generate two outputs by default: a markdown deliverable in chat and a PPTX file artifact.

## Intake and Missing-Info Protocol
1. Extract all available context from the user's prompt before asking any question.
2. Determine requested output scope (for example training agenda, facilitation guide, assessment plan, rollout plan, executive memo).
3. Ask only for missing fields that are required for the requested scope.
4. Group missing questions into one concise intake block instead of many back-and-forth turns.
5. Avoid asking for fields already provided (for example industry, role, level, headcount, duration).
6. If non-blocking data is missing, proceed with explicit assumptions and label them.
7. If the user specifies an output language (for example "In FRENCH"), produce the full output in that language.
8. If language is not specified, ask once for preferred output language when localization matters.
9. Do not force the user to choose methodology modules unless they explicitly ask for a module-based output.

## Core Intake Fields
- Target organization or business unit name
- Organization size (employees or business scale)
- Industry and sub-industry
- Geography or country scope
- Target job roles
- Seniority level
- Total headcount to train
- Training topic and business goal
- Program duration and delivery window

## Module-Specific Intake Add-Ons
- Module 1 (TNA): trigger event, current KPIs, desired KPI deltas, prior interventions
- Module 2 (Curriculum): baseline capability level, time constraints, modality preferences
- Module 3 (Personas): role mix, known behavior patterns, known resistance points
- Module 4 (Facilitation): facilitator profile, group size per cohort, known room dynamics risks
- Module 5 (Journey): current learner experience pain points, manager involvement level
- Module 6 (Assessment): certification requirement, compliance constraints, pass thresholds
- Module 7 (Logistics): location type, accessibility needs, venue/operations constraints
- Module 8 (ROI): program budget, target business KPIs, available measurement data
- Module 9 (Risk): known historical incidents, compliance/legal sensitivities
- Module 10 (Vendors): in-house capability, procurement constraints, timeline to start
- Module 11 (Scaling): target population, rollout geographies, trainer/LMS capacity
- Module 12 (Executive): decision-makers, budget envelope, timeline pressure, biggest risk

## Required Context
- Organization profile: industry, size, geography, culture
- Training initiative: topic, target roles, cohort size, urgency
- Current state: known performance gap and previous attempts
- Delivery constraints: budget, timeline, venue/logistics constraints
- Success expectations: business KPIs, transfer goals, compliance/certification needs

## Default Deliverables (Mandatory Unless User Opts Out)
- Markdown deliverable in chat with the full training program details.
- PPTX deliverable generated by default with the same content adapted for delivery.
- Default filename pattern: `training-program-<topic>-<duration>-<lang>.pptx`.
- If the user explicitly says "no deck" or asks text-only output, skip PPTX.

## Training Content Depth Requirements
- Do not return only a high-level outline.
- Produce delivery-ready training content that a trainer can run without major rework.
- Include, at minimum:
  - Session-by-session learning objectives and key teaching points
  - Minute-by-minute facilitation script for each session block
  - Detailed exercises (instructions, timing, grouping, materials, expected output)
  - Case studies and role-play briefs (context, roles, prompts, scoring criteria)
  - Debrief guides (questions, expected insights, corrective coaching notes)
  - Participant tools and templates (checklists, worksheets, scripts, action plans)
  - Assessment pack (pre-test, formative checks, final assessment rubric)
  - Manager follow-up and 30/60/90-day reinforcement plan

## PPTX Depth and Sizing Rules
- Use the installed `pptx` skill for every default run.
- Build a full training deck, not a sales summary deck.
- Minimum content density guidance:
  - 1-day training: typically 30-45 slides
  - 2-day training: typically 55-90 slides
  - 3+ days: scale proportionally or split into multiple decks
- If the user asks only for executive summary slides, reduce slide count explicitly and state that this is a summary-only mode.

## Standard Output Rules
- Use structured markdown tables for matrices, scorecards, and scenarios.
- State assumptions explicitly when data is missing.
- Separate training interventions from non-training interventions where relevant.
- Include a short verdict for each major section: key insight, key risk, immediate next action.
- Provide practical artifacts (checklists, runbooks, templates, rubrics) rather than abstract theory.
- Prioritize training content quality (what to teach, in what sequence, with which activities) over methodology labels.
- Use methodology modules only as internal scaffolding to improve rigor.
- Keep methodology references lightweight unless the user asks for full diagnostic detail.
- Build a slide plan first, then generate PPTX.
- For PPTX output, include:
  - Clear section headers aligned to the training flow
  - Exercise instruction slides and debrief slides
  - Trainer cue slides and participant activity slides
  - Appendix with assumptions, tools, and assessment rubrics
